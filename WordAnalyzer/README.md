# How to develop?

1. Use components to display text, text input and button.
2. Create analyzeWord function to process the text input by user.
3. Use split() method to split the string input into an array of substrings.
4. Use for loop and if-else statement to compare each substring with the written expression.
5. For each loop, if substring equals to (a,ei,o,u), then add number to vowels, else add number to consonants.
6. Use onPress event handler on the button to call analyzeWord() function.
